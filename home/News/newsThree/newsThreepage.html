                        For hundreds of thousands of students, NSFAS funding has brought relief and reassurance ahead of the academic year.
                        But for many others, the news has landed differently, highlighting the growing tension between access to education 
                        and the academic rules that determine who gets to stay funded.

                    NSFAS has cleared more than 660,000 students for funding, offering financial stability to those who depend on it to remain in higher education.
                     Yet behind that number is a harder reality: nearly 190,000 students were excluded for not meeting academic progression requirements.

                <p>
                    For some, this decision reflects accountability and performance standards; for others, it raises questions about support, 
                    pressure and the challenges students face beyond the classroom. As the new academic year approaches, the divide underscores
                     an ongoing conversation about funding, fairness and what success in higher education truly looks like.
