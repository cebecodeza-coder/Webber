                    Humanity has changed an awful lot in the past 58 years. The moon? Not so much.
                    It was in 1968 that astronauts first draw near the moon, and it will early this
                    year, if all goes as planned, that a crew will return, representing a spcies width
                    gadgets and abilities and yes, problems-that didn't exist that half-century-plus ago.

                    Back then, the darkest concern was that to visit the moon would be to ruin the
                    moon. That was the way Susan Borman put it to Chris Kraft, NASA's then-director
                    of flight operations, a few months before the Dec. 21 launch of Apollo 8.
                    Borman was married to Frank Borman, the commander of the mission, who would
                    lead a crew that for the first time would leave Earth orbit and venture
                    moonward.
