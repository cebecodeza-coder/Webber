            <h1>Humanities</h1>
            <p>
                Humanities is where human experience is examined, challenged and remembered. It confronts identity, 
                culture and history, asking uncomfortable questions about who we are and how we got here. Through stories, 
                ideas and critique, the humanities refuse easy answers—insisting instead on meaning, empathy and understanding 
                in a complex world.
