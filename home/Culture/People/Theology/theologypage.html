            <h1>Theology</h1>
            <p>
                Theology grapples with belief, meaning and the deepest questions of existence. 
                It examines faith not as certainty, but as struggle, interpretation and commitment in a complex world.
                 More than doctrine, theology challenges how people understand purpose, morality and their place within something greater 
                 than themselves.
