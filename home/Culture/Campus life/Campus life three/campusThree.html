                       The people you surround yourself with at university do more than fill your social circle—they quietly influence your habits,
                        mindset and direction. Friendships can either push you forward or slowly pull you off course.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Choosing your friends carefully means understanding that not every connection is harmless. Good friends encourage growth, hold 
                        you accountable and support you even when it's uncomfortable, while bad friends normalize self-sabotage, distraction and stagnation.
                         Over time, habits are shared—how you study, how you cope with stress, how you speak about your goals. “Show me your friends and I 
                         will show you your future” isn't just a saying; it's a reminder that the energy, discipline and values around you eventually become 
                         your own. In a space where students are shaping who they'll become, friendship is not just social—it's foundational.
