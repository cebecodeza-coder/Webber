                     Living on Empty: The Reality of Being Broke as a Student

                        For many students, being broke isn't a phase—it's a constant background stress that shapes daily choices and quiet anxieties. 
                        From skipped meals to missed opportunities, money, or the lack of it, follows students everywhere.

                        <br>

                        Being broke as a student affects more than just a bank balance—it impacts confidence, mental health and the way students experience 
                        university life. Every decision begins with a calculation: Can I afford this meal? Should I skip this event? Am I the only one constantly
                         checking my balance and hoping it lasts until month-end? These questions often go unanswered, leaving students to carry financial stress 
                         in silence. Yet the truth is, many students are navigating the same struggle, learning to survive, adapt and push forward in a system that
                        rarely acknowledges how deeply money shapes the student experience.
