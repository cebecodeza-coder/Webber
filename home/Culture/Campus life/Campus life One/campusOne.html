                        Valentine's Day on campus isn't just about couples and roses—it's a mirror reflecting how students experience love, 
                        pressure and connection in their own ways. Between expectations and reality, the day carries more meaning than it lets on.

                        For students, Valentine's Day often sits somewhere between romance and reality. While social media highlights grand gestures 
                        and picture-perfect couples, many students experience the day through friendships, self-love or quiet reflection. Love on campus 
                        isn't one-size-fits-all—it exists in late-night study sessions, shared meals, supportive texts and the comfort of being understood. 
                        In a space defined by growth and transition, Valentine's Day becomes less about who you're with and more about how love shows up in 
                        everyday student life.
