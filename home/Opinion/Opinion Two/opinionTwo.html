                        For many students, university isn't just academically demanding—it quietly tests their sense of worth.
                        The feeling of not being “good enough” often follows students into lecture halls, study sessions and exam rooms, 
                        even when no one else can see it.

                        Not feeling good enough for university is an experience more common than students admit. Surrounded by high achievers,
                        constant comparisons and unspoken expectations, it's easy to believe that everyone else belongs more than you do. 
                        This self-doubt can show up in skipped classes, burnout or the fear of asking for help, reinforcing the idea that struggling 
                        means failing. But feeling inadequate doesn't mean you don't deserve to be here—it often means you're learning, stretching and 
                        navigating an environment that was never meant to be easy
