                       The phrase “you haven't changed since first year” sits between
                         comfort and critique, <br> forcing students to question what growth really looks like.

                         “You haven't changed since first year” is one of those statements that lingers long after it's said. 
                         For some, it's reassuring—a reminder that their values, personality and sense of self have remained intact despite 
                         the chaos of university life. For others, it feels uncomfortable, suggesting that time passed without progress, 
                         lessons or visible growth. But change isn't always loud or obvious; sometimes it shows up in better boundaries, 
                         quieter confidence and the ability to survive what once felt impossible. In a space where students are constantly 
                         expected to evolve, the real question becomes whether change needs to be seen to be valid at all.
