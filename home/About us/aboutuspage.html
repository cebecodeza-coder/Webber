                <p>
                    Webber begins with a scene every student knows: rushing across campus, juggling classes, clubs and deadlines, trying to stay connected in the middle of it all.
                    It's in these everyday moments that Webber finds its stories. As a student newspaper, we cover campus culture and campus life, from tutoring resources and academic
                    support to events happening on and off campus. We look beyond headlines to highlight national news that matters to students, and we amplify the voices of individuals making an 
                    impact within their respective faculties. At its core, Webber exists to tell the stories that shape student life—honest, relatable, and written by students, for students.

                    Webber is built on conversation, curiosity and community, and we want to hear from you. Whether you have a story idea, an event you think deserves coverage, 
                    a perspective you want to share or a question about our work, our team is always open to connecting. Reach out to us to collaborate, contribute or simply start a
                    conversation—because Webber is at its best when it reflects the voices and experiences of the campus it serves.
