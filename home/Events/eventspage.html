            <h1>Events</h1>
            <p>
                Events are where campus life comes alive. They turn ordinary days into shared moments, 
                bringing students together through culture, conversation and celebration. Beyond the posters and planning, 
                events create connection—shaping memories that often last longer than the lectures themselves.

                    <p>
                        A cornerstone of student culture, NWU's RAG is known for show-stopping local artists and 
                        the famous float parade — an experience that demands your presence.

                    <span class = "date">20 Feb 2026</span>

                    <p>
                        Canvas is where creativity takes centre stage — an electrifying night at Ampi where students 
                        transform blank space into bold expression. With paint, passion, and atmosphere colliding, the event 
                        becomes more than art; it becomes a statement, a moment, a memory etched in colour.

                    <span class = "date">10 Feb 2026</span>

                    <p>
                        Cheerleading tryouts are where energy meets ambition — a high-intensity showcase of strength, rhythm, 
                        and fearless spirit. With every jump, lift, and count, athletes fight for their place on the mat, proving 
                        that cheer is not just performance, but power in motion.

                    <p>
                        NWU is set to ignite the Varsity Cup in a clash packed with intensity and power. Expect explosive speed, 
                        fearless breaks and bone-rattling tackles as every meter is fiercely contested. Under the lights, the action 
                        won't just be seen—it will be felt.
